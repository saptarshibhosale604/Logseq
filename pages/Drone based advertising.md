- What is your business's name?
	- FlyAds
- Describe your business
	- I am making a drone system.
	- The drones will fly through a particular area carrying the pamphlets or advertisement of the businesses.
	- So that businesses can advertise themselves in a very unique way.
- What differentiates your service from existing ad methods?
	- Current ad methods include pamphlets which are stuck on the stationary boards but in my business pamphlets are carried by drones which will highly attract the attention of the surrounding people.
	- And also advertising using drones will be a cooler way for businesses to advertise themselves.
- What is your customer acquisition strategy?
	- My customers are the businesses who want to advertise themselves.
	- I will be charged them according to the duration for which their ads are on the drone.
